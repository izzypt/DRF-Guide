# What we will build ?

In order to cover all those topics , we will build an API that will serve movie data , like an IMDV or WatchMate clone.

# Installation

In order to use DRF , first we need to start a Django project. We can do it very simply, by following those steps:

1) Create a project folder for your app
2) Create a virtual environment inside it , in order to keep our project packages isolated : ```python -m venv venv```
3) Inside it run ```python django-admin startproject <project-name>```
